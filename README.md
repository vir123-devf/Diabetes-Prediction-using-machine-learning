**Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning**

This project implements a machine learning system in Python to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**Objective**

The goal is to build a model that can effectively classify whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various health-related features. This can be valuable for early detection and preventative measures.

**Workflow**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - The project utilizes a diabetes dataset, typically provided in CSV format.
   - Ensure you have access to a suitable dataset (consider ethical implications of using medical data).

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - This crucial step involves cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
   - Standardization is particularly recommended for diabetes data, as it ensures features are on a similar scale.
   - Common techniques might include:
     - Handling missing values (imputation or removal)
     - Outlier detection and treatment (if necessary)

3. **Data Splitting:**
   - The data is divided into two sets: training and testing.
   - The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.
   - A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing, but you might experiment with different ratios.

4. **Model Training:**
   - SVM is employed as the primary classification model.
   - SVMs excel at finding hyperplanes that effectively separate data points belonging to different classes.
   - Hyperparameter tuning (adjusting model parameters) might be necessary to optimize performance.

5. **Prediction:**
   - Once trained, the model can be used to predict the likelihood of diabetes for new patient data points.
   - The model outputs a probability, allowing you to determine the risk of an individual developing diabetes.


**Requirements**

- Python(pycharm or other)
- Essential libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
  
**Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/vir123-devf/rock-mine-prediction.git`
2. Run the training script: `python train_model.py` (or similar)


**Ethical Considerations**

- Machine learning models are not perfect, and there might be biases in the data.
- This model should not be used for sole diagnosis. It's intended to be a decision-support tool for healthcare professionals.
